        <h2>World "π" Day</h2>
        <h4>• Pi Day is celebrated worldwide</h4>
        <p>
          Today, March 14, is International Mathematics Day and the Day of the
          Number Pi for the symbol π in mathematics, as this symbol is
          celebrated globally every year to recognize this mathematical
          constant. The Greek letter "π" is the symbol used in mathematics to
          represent a constant - the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
          diameter - which is 3.14159, which is approximately 3.14. According to
          the NDTV website, this day was chosen specifically because when this
          number is written in month/day format, it is (3/14) to match the first
          three digits of the mathematical constant. <br /><br />
          The event takes place on this specific date because the first digits
          of “π” are 3, 1, and 4, so the celebration coincides with the 14th day
          of the third month of the year. <br /><br />
          The celebration of World Mathematics Day includes many activities and
          events, such as lectures, workshops, competitions and exhibitions,
          that reflect the beauty and importance of mathematics. Mathematicians
          and educators also hope the symbol will help increase interest in
          mathematics and science through teaching, museum exhibits,
          competitions and more. Ultimately, the celebration of World
          Mathematics Day provides an opportunity to acknowledge the significant
          impact of mathematics on the development of our world and to inspire
          more individuals to pursue and value this vital and interesting
          subject.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to honoring π, the celebration works to inspire more
          academic research and interest in mathematics and science.
          <br /><br />
          Although the celebration is in honor of this sporting icon, many
          believe that it is an academic celebration, as schools, universities
          and museums around the world encourage this celebration.<br /><br />
          Here are some fun facts about "π": <br /><br />
          1- It is the sixteenth letter of the Greek alphabet.<br />
          2- It was proven to be an irrational number in the eighteenth century.
          <br />
          3- “π” Day falls on March 14, which is the birthday of the German
          genius, Albert Einstein. <br />
          4- It is impossible to know all the decimal numbers after the comma of
          the constant "π". <br />
          5- Using a powerful computer, Hitachi SR 8000, a Japanese scientist,
          discovered 1.24 trillion digits of “π,” breaking all previous records.
          <br />
          6- “π” appeared in many famous Hollywood films, as it was used as a
          secret code in “Hitchcock’s Torn Curtain” as well as in “The Net.”

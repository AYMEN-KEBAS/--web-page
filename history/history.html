        <h2>Date of World Pi Day</h2>
        <h4>• History of Pi Day</h4>
        <p>
          In 1988, physicist Larry Shaw first recognized a pi (π) day. In 2009,
          the US House of Representatives designated March 14 as Pi Day. Later,
          UNESCO celebrated Pi Day as “International Mathematics Day” during its
          General Conference in 2019. Physicist Shaw linked the pi numbers with
          March 14 to organize a special day for the staff of the Exploratorium
          in San Francisco. The mathematician and physicist, Albert Einstein,
          known for the general theory of relativity, was born on Pi 3/14 in
          1879. The value of pi was first calculated by a mathematician named
          Archimedes of Syracuse. It was later accepted by the scientific
          community when Leonhard Euler used the pi symbol in 1737. March 14 is
          also celebrated as "Pi Day" when the first 10 digits of pi were
          achieved at 9:26:53 a.m. in 2015 to form the exact moment Along with
          the date (3/14/15/92653). Pi is also part of Egyptian mythology, as
          people in Egypt believe that the pyramids of Giza were built on the
          principles of the number pi (pi). Every year, mathematics enthusiasts
          celebrate Pi Day with Pi party competitions and Pi Day exercises to
          stimulate interest in learning and practicing mathematics. Pi is
          calculated with over 50 trillion digits after the decimal point, it is
          an irrational number, infinitely long and its exact value cannot be
          known. Since the exact value of pi cannot be known, we can never find
          the exact area or circumference of a circle.
